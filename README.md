üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWelcome to the repository for my custom-designed Calculator App. This application provides a sleek, user-friendly interface for performing a variety of mathematical calculations. 

## Features:

- **Basic Calculations**: Perform addition‚ûï, subtraction‚ûñ, multiplication‚úñ, and division‚ûó with ease.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator's interface is fully responsive,
- **Keyboard Input**: For a more efficient experience, keyboard inputs are mapped to calculator buttons. You can perform calculations without having to click on the calculator's buttons.
- **Custom Fonts**: Utilize a digital-style font, *'Digital7Italic'*, to give the calculator a unique and *thematic* look.

## Design

*The calculator features a night-theme background, with a subtle glow effect on buttons upon interaction, creating an immersive experience. The interface scales to retain its appearance across different zoom levels, ensuring that it looks great at both 67% and 100% zoom in web browsers*.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

To enhance user experience, the following keyboard shortcuts have been integrated:

- **Numbers (0-9) and Decimal (.)**: Directly input numbers into the calculator.
- **Operations (+, -, *, /)**: Use these keys for basic mathematical operations.
- **Enter**: Functions like the equals (=) button, displaying the calculation result.
- **Backspace**: Deletes the last digit entered, similar to the 'DEL' button on the calculator.
- **Shift + Backspace**: Clears all input, equivalent to the 'AC' (All Clear) button.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply visit the link mentioned above to the hosted page to use the calculator. For local use, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
